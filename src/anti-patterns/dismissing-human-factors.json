      "text": "In a company migrating to a micro frontend architecture, leadership pressures all teams to quickly break apart a monolithic frontend, assigning technical tasks like splitting components and wiring up module federation without giving teams the time or autonomy to reorganize around domain ownership. Developers are micromanaged, expected to coordinate constant cross-team changes, and overloaded with deadlines, turning the migration into a stressful technical exercise rather than an opportunity to improve team autonomy. The company should be refocusing on empowering teams, allowing them to control their micro frontends, align work with their domain expertise, and set realistic delivery goals.",
