    "example": {
      "text": "Consider a digital banking system where the main screen is an MFE that integrates several fragments from other MFEs, such as an investment list, a chart showing bitcoin value variations, account balance, and credit card statement amount. This structure introduces a significant vulnerability: a single faulty fragment can potentially disrupt the entire main screen. To avoid it, all fragments must display a fallback message if unavailable and not raise the error to the screen.",
